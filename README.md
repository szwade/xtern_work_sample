# xtern_work_sample

I decided to focus on the restaurant aspect of this project due to personal time constraints. In this project, I demonstrate how to use the Google Map API to gain insights on nearby locations and use those insights to drive decisions. After collecting data on restaurants nearby the 5 proposed coworking spaces, I recommend that the Industrious Mass Ave location be used as it has the highest average nearby restaurants rating of all 5 options. This is visualized in the charts provided. Thus, as a 10-week plan, I would recommend that the top 10 restaurants closest to the decided upon coworking space be visited each week, in an order something like this:

Week  Restaurant_Name
1	  	Comida
2	  	Bluebeard
3	  	St. Elmo Steak House
4	  	Axum Ethiopian Restaurant
5	  	Harry & Izzy's
6	  	Livery
7	  	Vida
8	  	The Oakmont
9	  	Hinata Japanese Fine Dining
10  	Subito
